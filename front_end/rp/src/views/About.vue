    <h1>Welcome to RACE PTS</h1>
    <p>We believe that there's more to earn from your races than just a tee shirt. 
      People spend hundreds of dollars each year paying for 5K's Half Marathon's, Marathon's, 
      Bike races, Triathalons, and many other races. With RACE PTS, each race you participate in 
      can earn you credit to put towards future races. The more races you run, the more points you earn, which can be used 
      to participate in more races.</p>
